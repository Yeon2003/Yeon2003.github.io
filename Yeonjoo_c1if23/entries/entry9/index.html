        <h2>Review</h2>
		<p class="explanation">Having delved into Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis," I find a deep resonance with the exploration of isolation, relationships, conformity, and guilt. The portrayal of Gregor Samsa's solitude prompts reflection on the broader landscape of social disconnection. The familial dynamics presented in the narrative invite a reconsideration of personal relationships and their vulnerabilities within societal expectations. The theme of conformity sparks contemplation on the delicate balance between adhering to societal norms and maintaining individual identity. Additionally, the pervasive theme of guilt encourages introspection regarding personal responsibilities and societal pressures. This encounter with Kafka's thematic complexity prompts a nuanced perspective on the intricacies of the human experience.</p>
