                    <p>The night rain whispers outside the window.<br> The six-tatami room is a stranger’s country.<br><br>
                        Though I know the fate a poet is doleful,<br> Shall I craft a line of poem?<br><br>
                        After receiving tuition in an envelope <br> Where scent of sweat and love are snugly cradled,<br> I head to a lecture of an old professor,<br> With a college notebook under my arm.<br><br>
                        When I think about it, after losing<br> One, two, and all of my friends from childhood,
                        For what <br> Do I merely sink to water, alone?
                        It is a shameful thing.<br><br> That a poem is written so easily<br>When life is hard to live.
                        The six-tatami room is a stranger’s country<br><br> While the night rain whispers outside the window,
                        The ultimate I drive out a little darkness by lighting a lamp<br><br>And wait for the morning that will arrive like the new era.
                        I am the first handshake that stretches a small handand grabs myself with tears and consolation.</p>

            Yun Dong-ju (1917-1945) was a poet and an activist for Korean independence from Japanese colonization. His youthful poetry was initially filled with images of nature, religious
contemplations, and his love for European literature. These slowly gave away to his themes of resistance against the empire that simultaneously evoked his shame and guilt for his privileged life in the time his people’s suffering. In 1942, Yun Dong-ju left Korea to study English literature in Japan. Many Korean poets and writers by 1940s had either stopped writing or had become collaborators of the empire as its oppression grew worse. Yun became a member of a secret Korean student organization conspiring for Korean independence movement within the Japanese military. They were all arrested before the plan was set in motion. He died in prison at age 27. He was likely subjected to medical experimentations that led to his death.
